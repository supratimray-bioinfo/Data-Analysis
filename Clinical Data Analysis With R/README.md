Project Overview
This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of clinical trials data sourced from Kaggle: A Quick Overview of Clinical Trials by Aero Data Lab. The analysis explores sponsorship trends, enrollment behaviour, trial phases, and most frequently studied diseases.

Dataset Summary
Dataset: AERO-BirdsEye-Data.csv

Source: Kaggle – Aero Data Lab

Contains clinical trial metadata, including:

Condition – disease or condition being studied

Phase – Phase 1, 2, or 3

Enrollment – number of participants

Start_Year / Start_Month – trial start time

Status – trial progress (e.g., Completed, Withdrawn)

Key Findings
1. Top Sponsors by Trial Volume
The most active sponsor is GSK, with the highest number of trials.
A doughnut chart shows proportional trial contributions by top sponsors.

2. Cumulative Enrollment Trends
The cumulative enrollment plotted over time for each sponsor shows participant growth.
1.4 million led in participant numbers across all years.

3. Phase-Wise Breakdown
Sponsors differ in phase focus—some dominate early-phase research, others in Phase 3.
Percentages of trials per phase are shown per sponsor.

4. Top 10 Most Studied Conditions
Diabetes mellitus, Type 2 is the most frequently studied condition.
A vertical bar graph displays the top 10 researched diseases.

5. Halted Trials (Withdrawn, Terminated, Suspended)
A doughnut chart visualises the distribution of halted trials.
Most were terminated based on trial status.

6. Sponsor Stock Valuation (as of 2023-09-17)
A bar chart displays the market valuation of publicly traded sponsors.
Highest-valued firms include JNJ and AbbVie.
